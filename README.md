# infarox27
A small program to open a machine's network

Executes .vbs files and opens common ports (and maybe spreads through port 80) if functional

Disorganized because this is mostly just for hosting files and you need like 4 files and way to deploy it for it to function

#### `gomr` is an additional functionality that replaces `isc.py` if it's likely there won't be python on infected systems (this wouldnt completely break infarox because everything updates on pc restart so if it remains undetected issues wont likely occur even if swapping between `gomr` and `isc.py` there are improvements for this still being made)+ basically it can kinda break but if you know enough about where it'll be deploying and the most effective way to deploy it then you can fix that)

# Additional Functionalities with:

#### `.x4` (sugu tools) - https://github.com/randyman777777777/thesillyzone/tree/main/x4

#### `.e` (PowerShell script) - https://pastebin.com/0XHnJ5c4
#### `.e` doesnt function as-is because it tries to download a file that isn't hosted anymore but it's a good example of an easy PowerShell script to use with infarox27
